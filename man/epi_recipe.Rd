\title{Create a epi_recipe for preprocessing data}
\usage{
epi_recipe(x, ...)

\method{epi_recipe}{epi_df}(
  x,
  reference_date = NULL,
  formula = NULL,
  ...,
  vars = NULL,
  roles = NULL
)

\method{epi_recipe}{formula}(formula, data, reference_date = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x, data}{An epi_df of the \emph{template} data set (see below).}

\item{...}{Further arguments passed to or from other methods (not currently
used).}

\item{reference_date}{Either a date of the same class as the \code{time_value}
column in the \code{epi_df} or \code{NULL}. If a date, it gives the date to which all
operations are relative. Typically, in real-time tasks this is the date that
the model is created (and presumably trained). In forecasting, this is
often the same as the most recent date of
data availability, but when data is "latent" (reported after the date to
which it corresponds), or if performing a nowcast, the \code{reference_date} may
be later than this. Setting \code{reference_date}
to a value BEFORE the most recent data is not a true "forecast",
because future data is being used to create the model, but this may be
reasonable in model building, nowcasting (predicting finalized values from
preliminary data), or if producing a backcast. If \code{NULL}, it will be set
to the \code{as_of} date of the \code{epi_df}.}

\item{formula}{A model formula. No in-line functions should be used here
(e.g. \code{log(x)}, \code{x:y}, etc.) and minus signs are not allowed. These types of
transformations should be enacted using \code{step} functions in this package.
Dots are allowed as are simple multivariate outcome terms (i.e. no need for
\code{cbind}; see Examples).}

\item{vars}{A character string of column names corresponding to variables
that will be used in any context (see below)}

\item{roles}{A character string (the same length of \code{vars}) that
describes a single role that the variable will take. This value could be
anything but common roles are \code{"outcome"}, \code{"predictor"},
\code{"time_value"}, and \code{"geo_value"}}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{recipe} with sub-objects:
\item{var_info}{A tibble containing information about the original data set
columns.}
\item{term_info}{A tibble that contains the current set of terms in the
data set. This initially defaults to the same data contained in
\code{var_info}.}
\item{steps}{A list of \code{step} or \code{check} objects that define the sequence
of preprocessing operations that will be applied to data. The default value
is \code{NULL}.}
\item{template}{A tibble of the data. This is initialized to be the same as
the data given in the \code{data} argument but can be different after the recipe
is trained.}
}
\description{
A recipe is a description of the steps to be applied to a data set in
order to prepare it for data analysis. This is a loose wrapper
around \code{\link[recipes:recipe]{recipes::recipe()}} to properly handle the additional
columns present in an \code{epi_df}
