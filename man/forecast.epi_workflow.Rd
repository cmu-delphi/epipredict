\usage{
\method{forecast}{epi_workflow}(
  object,
  ...,
  n_recent = NULL,
  reference_date = NULL,
  predict_interval = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An epi workflow.}

\item{...}{Not used.}

\item{n_recent}{Integer or NULL. If filling missing data with locf = TRUE,
how far back are we willing to tolerate missing data? Larger values allow
more filling. The default NULL will determine this from the the recipe. For
example, suppose n_recent = 3, then if the 3 most recent observations in any
geo_value are all NA’s, we won’t be able to fill anything, and an error
message will be thrown. (See details.)}

\item{reference_date}{By default, this is set to the maximum time_value in x.
But if there is data latency such that recent NA's should be filled, this may
be after the last available time_value.}

\item{predict_interval}{A time interval or integer. The length of time before
the \code{forecast_date} to consider for the forecast. The default is 1 year,
which you will likely only need to make longer if you are doing long
forecast horizons, or shorter if you are forecasting using an expensive
model.}
}
\value{
A forecast tibble.
