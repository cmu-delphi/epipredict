# epipredict 0.2

## Breaking changes

- Moved example datasets from being hosted in the package to being loaded
  from the `epidatasets` package. The datasets can no longer be loaded with
  `data(<dataset name>)`, but can be accessed with
  `data(<dataset name>, package = "epidatasets")`, `epidatasets::<dataset name>`
  or, after loading the package, the name of the dataset alone (#382).
- `step_adjust_latency()` no longer allows empty column selection.
- Addresses upstream breaking changes from cmu-delphi/epiprocess#595 (`growth_rate()`). 
  `step_growth_rate()` has lost its `additional_gr_args_list` argument and now
  has an `na_rm` argument.
- Moves `epiprocess` out of depends (#440). No internals have changed, but downstream
  users may need to add `library(epiprocess)` to existing code.

## Improvements

- Add `step_adjust_latency`, which give several methods to adjust the forecast if the `forecast_date` is after the last day of data.
- Fix `layer_population_scaling` default `by` with `other_keys`.
- Make key column inference more consistent within the package and with current `epiprocess`.
- Fix `quantile_reg()` producing error when asked to output just median-level predictions.
- (temporary) ahead negative is allowed for `step_epi_ahead` until we have `step_epi_shift`
- Add `reference_date` as an argument to `epi_recipe()`
- Add `step_climate()` to create "climate" predictor in forecast workflows
- Add `climatological_forecaster()` to automatically create climate baselines

## Bug fixes

- Shifting no columns results in no error for either `step_epi_ahead` and `step_epi_lag`
- Quantiles produced by `grf` were sometimes out of order.
- dist_quantiles can have all `NA` values without causing unrelated errors
- adjust default quantiles throughout so that they match.
- force `layer_residual_quantiles()` to always include `0.5`.
- Rename `recipes:::check_training_set()` to `recipes:::validate_training_data()`, as it changed in recipes 1.1.0.

- `layer_predict()` and `predict.epi_workflow()` will now appropriately forward
  `...` args intended for `predict.model_fit()`

  non-`epi_df` data is given to `epi_recipe()`), #363
- Try to retain the `epi_df` class during baking to the extent possible, #376
